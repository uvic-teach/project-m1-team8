# MisterEd

## System Description:

The MisterEd system is envisioned as a solution aimed at mitigating the burdens of overcrowding and prolonged wait times within Emergency Departments (EDs) across Canada. It is designed to allows users to both check the current load of the ER as well as register/log in for a virtual triage. The virtual triage involves the user providing necessary medical information, allowing the system to conduct an initial assessment of their condition. After this virtual triage is complete, their patient data will be updated and the user will be notified of which actions they should follow. In cases where an ER visit is deemed necessary, the system integrates the user into a virtual ER queue, prioritizing them based on the urgency of their condition. The user will then be notified when the ER is ready for them (front of the queue), significantly reducing their wait time and enhancing the overall ED experience. The system will reserves a spot for the user at the ER for a designated period, after which the user will be removed from the queue. If the patient may not require an ER visit, they will be directed to suitable alternatives, relayed to either a nurse hotline, regular primary care clinic, or over-the counter-medication. Thus, the system helps to optimize the utilization of healthcare resources and promote timely and appropriate care for all users.

## Use Case Specifications
### Use Case UC-01 System Overview
| Use Case    | UC-01 System Overview                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Description**    | This use case provides an overview of how to access and use the MisterEd system. |
| **Assumption**     |The user is seeking medical guidance or assistance through the MisterEd system. They may be experiencing a health issue or concern and are using MisterEd to assess whether their situation requires a visit to an Emergency Department (ED). Users may choose to either create a new MisterEd account if using the system for the first time or log in with their existing account for access. |
| **Actors**         | - User/Patient|
| **Steps**          | 1. **User Registration/Login:**<br> - The user either logs in with their existing MisterEd account or registers for a new account for the first time.<br> 2. **Assessment for Nearby ED Availability:**<br> - The user determines if there is an available Emergency Department (ED) nearby.<br> 3. **Health Information Submission:**<br> - The user utilizes MisterEd to provide personal health information to begin a virtual triage. <br> 4. **Virtual Triage:**<br> - The system conducts a virtual triage based on the provided health information to determine the appropriate course of action for the user. <br> 5. **User Notification:** <br> - The system notifies the user of the recommended action based on the triage result. <br>    5.1. If the user should visit a nearby ED:<br> - The system searches for a spot in the queue at the nearest clinic. <br> - The user is notified when an ED slot becomes available, and the system assists the user in registering for it. <br>   5.2. Otherwise, if the user should receive medical assistance through alternative means: <br> 5.2.1 If the user should receive a prescription: <br> - The system notifies the user of the nearby pharmacy where they can obtain their prescribed medication. <br> 5.2.2 If the user should talk to a nurse via a hotline: <br> - The system notifies the user and provides access to a nurse hotline for immediate assistance. <br> 5.2.3 If the user should visit a clinic to see a GP: <br> - The system notifies the user of a nearby clinic and assists in setting up an appointment with a General Physician (GP). |
| **Variations**     |     |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | **Reliability:** Given the potential urgency of a user’s needs, the system must ensure that status notifications reach the respective recipients as soon as possible. <br> **Security**: The system must stores the encrypted data and regularly perform data backup of sensitive user information, including the detail results of user's triage. <br> **Security**: The system will follow the standard policies, such as Protection of Privacy and Access to Information Policy, guaranteeing the safety of user's personal information stored ( location, health record, medicine prescription, passwords, etc.) <br>|
| **Issues**         | - **Miscummunication:** In some cases, the system may misinterpret user health information, resulting in incorrect recommendations. <br> - **Inconsistent Notifications:** Users report receiving inconsistent or delayed notifications regarding the availability of ED spots or appointments. <br> - **System overload**: The system may face potential issues if a large number of patients simultaneously access the triage feature, leading to the possibility of system overload and crashes. Additionally, given the current ED crisis in Canada, there may not be a sufficient number of available ED slots for patients to book through the system, which could impact user experience and service availability.|

| Use case       | UC-05 Assign User To ER Queue |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description    | User is assigned to an appropriate ER queue position using user location and virtual triage data.              
| Actors         | Patient/User                       
| Assumption     | The patient provides correct information about their health condition and finishes the triage and their data is correctly processed. |
| Steps          | 1. The information from the triage is used to determine the urgency and position in ED queue that the user will take. <br> 2. User is informed of their current position in queue. <br>  3. When the user has reached the front of the queue, they will be notified again to come to the ED. <br> 4. When the user arrives at the ED, they are ID'd and matched to their online information, and then processed accordingly by ED front desk operator. <br> 5. Once processed the user is removed from the queue.
| Variations     |   1. User may decide to cancel and be removed from the queue. <br> 2. User fails to arrive within specified time frame, they are removed from the queue and notified.|
| Non-functional | **Reliability**: ER queue system must be reliable 95% of the time. Down time is acceptable as users will just go to the ED in person. <br> **Priority**: ER queue system must be able to effectivley decide urgency and priority of users in such a manner that users do not deem it nessecary to show up to the ED before their alloted time. |
| Issues         |   How does the ED staff interact with the system? How are in-person ED visitors accounted for in the system? |
