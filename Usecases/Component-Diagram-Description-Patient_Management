One of the components in the Patient Management Component Diagram is the TriageRecord, which is 
responsible for maintaining a comprehensive log of all triages conducted by the user. This component 
plays a vital role in tracking and organizing user interactions within the triage system, ensuring a 
detailed record of all triage-related activities. Another essential component is the Account Management, 
which is further divided into two distinct branches: HealthInformation and AccountInformation. The 
HealthInformation branch stores crucial details about the user's health, forming a repository for 
pertinent health-related data. On the other hand, the AccountInformation branch encompasses essential 
user account details, including username, password, and other relevant information. These components 
collectively form a robust structure, facilitating efficient management of both user interactions and 
sensitive account data within the system.
