The first thing a client will see when accessing our service 
will be the UI and how it is portrayed. This web server contains
a HTML website,a .css file for display styles, and a javascript file
to request tasks using fast API. Fast API is an efficient web framework for connecting the web server and the application server.
On the application server are three types of services: Authentication, Notification, and a Triage data gatherer. The Authentication service takes a username and password from the website, then communicates with the patient management microservice to determine the validity of the credentials. After Validity/Denial, the website will update accordingly. The notification service will generate a text message according to the current ask (such as a login success message) and display it on the webpage for a set period. The triage data gatherer communicates with the patient management microservice to obtain the data from the user's most recent triage and display it on the webpage.
