For the Mister ED System, this sequence diagram outlines the streamlined process of user registration. Initiated by the patient/user, 
the sequence commences when they click the "Registration" button on the welcome/home page. Upon this action, the system redirects the 
user to a dedicated registration page where they input their desired login credentials. The system rigorously validates these credentials 
with the patient database, ensuring the uniqueness and compliance with system requirements. If successful, the system creates a new account 
for the user and sends the user a verification email to validate the user’s new account. After the verifies the email, the registration 
process is complete. The alternate outcome of this scenario that might occur is if the user attempts to re-register with existing credentials.
If the user tries to re-register with existing credentials then the system would send the “Account already Exists” message to the user, so that
the user could enter different credentials to create their account.
