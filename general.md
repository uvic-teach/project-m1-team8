| **Description**    | This use case provides an overview of how to access and use the MisterEd system. |
| **Assumption**     |The user is seeking medical guidance or assistance through the MisterEd system. They may be experiencing a health issue or concern and are using MisterEd to assess whether their situation requires a visit to an Emergency Department (ED). Users may choose to either create a new MisterEd account if using the system for the first time or log in with their existing account for access. |
| **Actors**         | - User/Patient|
| **Steps**          | 1. **User Registration/Login:**<br> - The user either logs in with their existing MisterEd account or registers for a new account for the first time.<br> 2. **Assessment for Nearby ED Availability:**<br> - The user determines if there is an available Emergency Department (ED) nearby.<br> 3. **Health Information Submission:**<br> - The user utilizes MisterEd to provide personal health information to begin a virtual triage. <br> 4. **Virtual Triage:**<br> - The system conducts a virtual triage based on the provided health information to determine the appropriate course of action for the user. <br> 5. **User Notification:** <br> - The system notifies the user of the recommended action based on the triage result. <br><br>    5.1. If the user should visit a nearby ED:<br> - The system searches for a spot in the queue at the nearest clinic. <br> - The user is notified when an ED slot becomes available, and the system assists the user in registering for it. <br> <br>   5.2. Otherwise, if the user should receive medical assistance through alternative means: <br> 5.2.1 If the user should receive a prescription: <br> - The system notifies the user of the nearby pharmacy where they can obtain their prescribed medication. <br> 5.2.2 If the user should talk to a nurse via a hotline: <br> - The system notifies the user and provides access to a nurse hotline for immediate assistance. <br> 5.2.3 If the user should visit a clinic to see a GP: <br> - The system notifies the user of a nearby clinic and assists in setting up an appointment with a General Physician (GP). |
| **Variations**     |     |
| **Non-Functional Requirements** | **Reliability:** Given the potential urgency of a user’s needs, the system must ensure that status notifications reach the respective recipients as soon as possible. |
| **Issues**         | - **Miscummunication:** In some cases, the system may misinterpret user health information, resulting in incorrect recommendations. <br> - **Inconsistent Notifications:** Users report receiving inconsistent or delayed notifications regarding the availability of ED spots or appointments. <br> - **System overload**: The system may face potential issues if a large number of patients simultaneously access the triage feature, leading to the possibility of system overload and crashes. Additionally, given the current ED crisis in Canada, there may not be a sufficient number of available ED slots for patients to book through the system, which could impact user experience and service availability.|
