Description of the State Diagram

The state diagram represents the "Patient Management" process using the Mister ED System. Initially, the 
user interacts with the system by either requesting to log in or clicking on "Create an Account." In the 
account creation pathway, the system directs the user to a registration website where they input their credentials 
to establish a new account. Upon successful registration, the Mister ED System sends a confirmation email. The 
user completes the registration by confirming the email. In the login pathway, upon the user's request to log in, 
the system checks the user's credentials. If they are valid, the login is successful; if not, the account is marked 
as invalid. Post-login, the user can request to access personal health information or their triage record. The system 
acknowledges these requests by receiving them and then subsequently shows the requested data, be it personal health 
records or triage record history, stored within the system.
