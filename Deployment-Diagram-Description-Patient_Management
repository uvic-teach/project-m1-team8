At the heart of the system lies a Patient Database Server, running on a Linux operating system, serving as the central repository for 
patient data. This server hosts two critical schemas: TriageRecordSchema and UserHealthInfoSchema, which define the structure and 
relationships within the patient records. The communication between the server and the application components is facilitated through 
FastApi, a modern and efficient web framework. FastApi acts as the bridge, ensuring seamless interactions between the server and the 
User Interface (UI). The system's architecture extends further with the incorporation of an Account Management execution environment. 
This component manages user accounts and interactions, ensuring data security and access control. Additionally, the system incorporates 
a Patient: RDBMS execution environment, emphasizing the utilization of relational database management systems tailored specifically for 
patient data. The integration of SQLAlchemy, a powerful SQL toolkit, enhances database management efficiency, ensuring smooth communication 
between the server and the schemas. In this configuration, the system's components are interlinked, guaranteeing a secure, efficient, and 
highly responsive healthcare management system that caters to diverse user needs.
