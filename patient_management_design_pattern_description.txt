The Patient Management microservice is designed following the API gateway design pattern, 
ensuring a structured and efficient architecture. It comprises various modules, each with 
a specific role in processing API requests originating from the UI side. These modules are
crucial in retrieving relevant information to fulfill user requests, pulling data from diverse databases.
They access information related to user health and user account details, among other services. 
It is worth noting that the architecture allows for flexibility and robustness, as some modules are adeptly 
connected to more than one database. This connectivity ensures a seamless flow of information and enhances 
the system's ability to provide comprehensive and accurate responses to user queries.
