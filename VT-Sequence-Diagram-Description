In the Virtual Triage sequence, the process initiates with the user logging into the Mister ED System. Upon login, the user triggers 
the virtual triage. The system responds by retrieving questions from the Triage Module for the user, then evaluating the severity of 
their medical condition based on the answers provided by the user. Based on the user's responses, the system determines the appropriate 
course of action, directing the user to either visit the Emergency Room (ER), a nearby clinic, or a pharmacy for over-the-counter medicine. 
Alternatively, the user can opt for a remote consultation via the nurse hotline. Throughout this process, the system ensures a seamless 
flow of interactions, confirming the user's choice and providing additional instructions when necessary. At the end of the triage, the 
result on what action the user should follow would be displayed on the userâ€™s screen, and the patient database to keep a log of the triages, 
and the results.
